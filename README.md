# Genshin Gacha simulator x Polygon Mumbai

This project utilizes the immuable properties of blockchain and verifable random numbers from Chainlink to deliver a verifably random, tamper proof gacha experience.

Planning to migrate to foundry and write tests on there instead... 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
